# ThinVSFatTailed
A demonstration of the difference between convergence of thin and fat tailed distributions

I recently saw an old video of Nassim Talebs on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDY_fh2TVlI) and decided to try to reproduce his results. As is apparent, the mean of an iid sample from fat tailed distribution does not reliably converge up to a sample size of 30,000 (!!!) but that of a standard normal distribution converges almost immediatly. Cool stuff!
