# ThinVSFatTailed
A demonstration of the difference between the convergence of thin and fat tailed distributions

I recently saw an old video of Nassim Taleb's on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDY_fh2TVlI) and tried to reproduce his results.  As is apparent, the mean of an iid sample from fat tailed distribution does not reliably converge up to a sample size of 30,000 (!!!), but that of a standard normal distribution converges almost immediately. Cool stuff!
