# ThinVSFatTailed
A demonstration of the difference between the convergence of thin and fat tailed variables.

This is a reproduction of results from Nassim Taleb on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDY_fh2TVlI). The mean of an iid sample from a fat tailed distribution does not reliably converge, even for a sample size of 30,000 (!!!). The thin tailed distribution's mean converges almost immediately.
